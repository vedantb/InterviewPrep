`Array` is one of the fundamental blocks in data structure. Since a `string` is just formed by an array of characters, they are both similar.

An `array` is a basic data structure to `store a collection of elements sequentially`. But elements can be `accessed randomly` since each element in the array can be identified by an array `index`.

An array can have one or more dimensions.
